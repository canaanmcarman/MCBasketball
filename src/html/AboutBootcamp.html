        <h3>WHAT IS THE PROGRAM?</h3>
        <p>
            The Java Web Developer Boot Camp is an 8 hour a day (9 am - 5 pm, M-F) 8-week,
            immersive software engineering program funded by the Department of Labor. T
            his course aims to increase the number of skilled software developers in this country.
            We do this by accepting qualified candidates who cannot afford the cost of a coding boot camp.
            If accepted into the program all fees will be covered by the program.
        <h2>What will you learn?</h2>
        he Java Web Development Bootcamp takes you from your first java program to developing a web application.
        This course will give you a fast start on your career so you can take it to the next
        The course will teach you by forcing you to write over 130 java applications, including 5 major web applications.
        Programming challenges will keep you on your toes.
        You'll learn to create web pages. You'll use frameworks and stored procedures.
        You'll connect to a database using the Java Persistence API(JPA) and Hibernate, and most importantly, all assignments
        are submitted through git, so you will learn to develop using best practices in class, to make it easy to contribute value when you are on the job.
        <h3>What is the criteria for admision?</h3>
        Applicants must be passionate about coding and have the drive to succeed in an immersive environment.
        Our ideal candidate is an Information Systems or Computer Science major who is either at least a rising junior or graduated within the last six years.
        If a student doesn't meet those criteria, they can participate in a special one
        week mini-camp to assess their ability to learn in this environment.
        Applicants also must be unemployed or underemployed to qualify for the grant. In the state of Maryland, a person who makes $42,000 or less
        is underemployed. Must be able to work in the United States.<br> <br>
